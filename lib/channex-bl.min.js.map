Here's an example chat room example where `\"new_msg\"`\n// events are listened for, messages are pushed to the server, and\n// the channel is joined with ok/error/timeout matches:\n//\n//     let channel = socket.channel(\"room:123\", {token: roomToken})\n//     channel.on(\"new_msg\", msg => console.log(\"Got message\", msg) )\n//     $input.onEnter( e => {\n//       channel.push(\"new_msg\", {body: e.target.val}, 10000)\n//        .receive(\"ok\", (msg) => console.log(\"created message\", msg) )\n//        .receive(\"error\", (reasons) => console.log(\"create failed\", reasons) )\n//        .receive(\"timeout\", () => console.log(\"Networking issue...\") )\n//     })\n//     channel.join()\n//       .receive(\"ok\", ({messages}) => console.log(\"catching up\", messages) )\n//       .receive(\"error\", ({reason}) => console.log(\"failed join\", reason) )\n//       .receive(\"timeout\", () => console.log(\"Networking issue. Still waiting...\") )\n//\n//\n// ## Joining\n//\n// Creating a channel with `socket.channel(topic, params)`, binds the params to\n// `channel.params`, which are sent up on `channel.join()`.\n// Subsequent rejoins will send up the modified params for\n// updating authorization params, or passing up last_message_id information.\n// Successful joins receive an \"ok\" status, while unsuccessful joins\n// receive \"error\".\n//\n// ## Duplicate Join Subscriptions\n//\n// While the client may join any number of topics on any number of channels,\n// the client may only hold a single subscription for each unique topic at any\n// given time. When attempting to create a duplicate subscription,\n// the server will close the existing channel, log a warning, and\n// spawn a new channel for the topic. The client will have their\n// `channel.onClose` callbacks fired for the existing channel, and the new\n// channel join will have its receive hooks processed as normal.\n//\n// ## Pushing Messages\n//\n// From the previous example, we can see that pushing messages to the server\n// can be done with `channel.push(eventName, payload)` and we can optionally\n// receive responses from the push. Additionally, we can use\n// `receive(\"timeout\", callback)` to abort waiting for our other `receive` hooks\n//  and take action after some period of waiting. The default timeout is 5000ms.\n//\n//\n// ## Socket Hooks\n//\n// Lifecycle events of the multiplexed connection can be hooked into via\n// `socket.onError()` and `socket.onClose()` events, ie:\n//\n//     socket.onError( () => console.log(\"there was an error with the connection!\") )\n//     socket.onClose( () => console.log(\"the connection dropped\") )\n//\n//\n// ## Channel Hooks\n//\n// For each joined channel, you can bind to `onError` and `onClose` events\n// to monitor the channel lifecycle, ie:\n//\n//     channel.onError( () => console.log(\"there was an error!\") )\n//     channel.onClose( () => console.log(\"the channel has gone away gracefully\") )\n//\n// ### onError hooks\n//\n// `onError` hooks are invoked if the socket connection drops, or the channel\n// crashes on the server. In either case, a channel rejoin is attempted\n// automatically in an exponential backoff manner.\n//\n// ### onClose hooks\n//\n// `onClose` hooks are invoked only in two cases. 1) the channel explicitly\n// closed on the server, or 2). The client explicitly closed, by calling\n// `channel.leave()`\n//\n//\n// ## Presence\n//\n// The `Presence` object provides features for syncing presence information\n// from the server with the client and handling presences joining and leaving.\n//\n// ### Syncing initial state from the server\n//\n// `Presence.syncState` is used to sync the list of presences on the server\n// with the client's state. An optional `onJoin` and `onLeave` callback can\n// be provided to react to changes in the client's local presences across\n// disconnects and reconnects with the server.\n//\n// `Presence.syncDiff` is used to sync a diff of presence join and leave\n// events from the server, as they happen. Like `syncState`, `syncDiff`\n// accepts optional `onJoin` and `onLeave` callbacks to react to a user\n// joining or leaving from a device.\n//\n// ### Listing Presences\n//\n// `Presence.list` is used to return a list of presence information\n// based on the local state of metadata. By default, all presence\n// metadata is returned, but a `listBy` function can be supplied to\n// allow the client to select which metadata to use for a given presence.\n// For example, you may have a user online from different devices with\n// a metadata status of \"online\", but they have set themselves to \"away\"\n// on another device. In this case, the app may choose to use the \"away\"\n// status for what appears on the UI. The example below defines a `listBy`\n// function which prioritizes the first metadata which was registered for\n// each user. This could be the first tab they opened, or the first device\n// they came online from:\n//\n//     let state = {}\n//     state = Presence.syncState(state, stateFromServer)\n//     let listBy = (id, {metas: [first, ...rest]}) => {\n//       first.count = rest.length + 1 // count of this user's presences\n//       first.id = id\n//       return first\n//     }\n//     let onlineUsers = Presence.list(state, listBy)\n//\n//\n// ### Example Usage\n//\n//     // detect if user has joined for the 1st time or from another tab/device\n//     let onJoin = (id, current, newPres) => {\n//       if(!current){\n//         console.log(\"user has entered for the first time\", newPres)\n//       } else {\n//         console.log(\"user additional presence\", newPres)\n//       }\n//     }\n//     // detect if user has left from all tabs/devices, or is still present\n//     let onLeave = (id, current, leftPres) => {\n//       if(current.metas.length === 0){\n//         console.log(\"user has left from all devices\", leftPres)\n//       } else {\n//         console.log(\"user left from a device\", leftPres)\n//       }\n//     }\n//     let presences = {} // client's initial empty presence state\n//     // receive initial presence data from server, sent after join\n//     myChannel.on(\"presence_state\", state => {\n//       presences = Presence.syncState(presences, state, onJoin, onLeave)\n//       displayUsers(Presence.list(presences))\n//     })\n//     // receive \"presence_diff\" from server, containing join/leave events\n//     myChannel.on(\"presence_diff\", diff => {\n//       presences = Presence.syncDiff(presences, diff, onJoin, onLeave)\n//       this.setState({users: Presence.list(room.presences, listBy)})\n//     })\n//\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  Channel: require('./channel'),\n  Socket: require('./socket'),\n  Presence: require('./presence'),\n}","\nclass Push {\n\n  // Initializes the Push\n  //\n  // channel - The Channel\n  // event - The event, for example `\"phx_join\"`\n  // payload - The payload, for example `{user_id: 123}`\n  // timeout - The push timeout in milliseconds\n  //\n  constructor(channel, event, payload, timeout){\n    this.channel      = channel\n    this.event        = event\n    this.payload      = payload || {}\n    this.receivedResp = null\n    this.timeout      = timeout\n    this.timeoutTimer = null\n    this.recHooks     = []\n    this.sent         = false\n  }\n\n  resend(timeout){\n    this.timeout = timeout\n    this.cancelRefEvent()\n    this.ref          = null\n    this.refEvent     = null\n    this.receivedResp = null\n    this.sent         = false\n    this.send()\n  }\n\n  send(){ if(this.hasReceived(\"timeout\")){ return }\n    this.startTimeout()\n    this.sent = true\n    this.channel.socket.push({\n      topic: this.channel.topic,\n      event: this.event,\n      payload: this.payload,\n      ref: this.ref,\n    })\n  }\n\n  receive(status, callback){\n    if(this.hasReceived(status)){\n      callback(this.receivedResp.response)\n    }\n\n    this.recHooks.push({status, callback})\n    return this\n  }\n\n\n  // private\n\n  matchReceive({status, response, ref}){\n    this.recHooks.filter( h => h.status === status )\n                 .forEach( h => h.callback(response) )\n  }\n\n  cancelRefEvent(){ if(!this.refEvent){ return }\n    this.channel.off(this.refEvent)\n  }\n\n  cancelTimeout(){\n    clearTimeout(this.timeoutTimer)\n    this.timeoutTimer = null\n  }\n\n  startTimeout(){ if(this.timeoutTimer){ return }\n    this.ref      = this.channel.socket.makeRef()\n    this.refEvent = this.channel.replyEventName(this.ref)\n\n    this.channel.on(this.refEvent, payload => {\n      this.cancelRefEvent()\n      this.cancelTimeout()\n      this.receivedResp = payload\n      this.matchReceive(payload)\n    })\n\n    this.timeoutTimer = setTimeout(() => {\n      this.trigger(\"timeout\", {})\n    }, this.timeout)\n  }\n\n  hasReceived(status){\n    return this.receivedResp && this.receivedResp.status === status\n  }\n\n  trigger(status, response){\n    this.channel.trigger(this.refEvent, {status, response})\n  }\n}\n\nmodule.exports = Push","const {\n  VSN,\n  CHANNEL_EVENTS,\n  TRANSPORTS,\n  SOCKET_STATES,\n  DEFAULT_TIMEOUT,\n  WS_CLOSE_NORMAL ,\n} = require('./constants')\n\nconst querystring = require('querystring')\nconst WebSocket = require('websocket').w3cwebsocket\nconst Timer = require('./timer')\nconst Channel = require('./channel')\n\nclass Socket {\n\n  // Initializes the Socket\n  //\n  // endPoint - The string WebSocket endpoint, ie, \"ws://example.com/socket\",\n  //                                               \"wss://example.com\"\n  //                                               \"/socket\" (inherited host & protocol)\n  // opts - Optional configuration\n  //   transport - The Websocket Transport, for example WebSocket.\n  //\n  //   encode - The function to encode outgoing messages.
